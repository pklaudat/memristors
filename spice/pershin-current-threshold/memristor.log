Fatal error found by spectre during license check-out.
    FATAL: Cannot launch this application because the current license server version is no longer compatible. Upgrade the license server to FlexNet 11.16.4.0 (or later) by downloading and installing the latest Lic+Config_Utils release from downloads.cadence.com and then launch the application again.
    FATAL (SPECTRE-209): Cannot run the simulation because the required license could not be checked out. Check the license usage in the license server or use the license queuing feature (+lqtimeout <timeout_value> in the command line) to wait until the required license is available. For more information about +lqtimeout, type 'spectre -h'.
